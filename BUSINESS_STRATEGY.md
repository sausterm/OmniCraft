## 1. Product Tiers & Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Philosophy
- **Hybrid Credits Model** - Pay-per-use with optional subscription
- **Matches user behavior** - Painting is project-based, not daily
- **Low friction** - One-time purchase feels smaller than recurring
- **Value-based** - Each output feels valuable, not disposable

### Why Credits > Pure Subscription

| Factor | Pure Subscription | Credits Model |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| Matches painting frequency | No (sporadic use) | Yes |
| User resentment | High (paying idle months) | Low |
| Conversion rate | 3-5% | 8-12% |
| Churn risk | High | N/A (no recurring) |
| Acquisition friction | High | Low |

**Key insight**: Most users paint 1-5 times per year. They resent paying monthly for something they use occasionally.
