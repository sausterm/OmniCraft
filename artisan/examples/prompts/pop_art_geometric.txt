Romero Britto pop art style. VERY thick black outlines like stained glass dividing image into LARGE geometric sections. Break subjects into big, angular, simplified shapes - NOT small segments. Each large section gets ONE extremely bright, saturated, VIBRANT color (neon primary colors: electric red, bright blue, sunshine yellow, hot pink, vivid orange, lime green, purple, turquoise). Mostly SOLID flat colors in each section. Only add SIMPLE decorative patterns (hearts, dots, circles, stripes, flowers) to SOME sections - keep it minimal and clean. Completely flat 2D - zero shading or depth. High saturation, maximum brightness, tropical color palette. Cheerful, energetic, joyful mood. CRITICAL: Preserve the EXACT subjects - same dogs, same faces, same positions, same poses, same markings (black eye patch on white dog, brown coloring on other dog). Keep original composition and subject identity perfectly intact. Transform style only, not content.
